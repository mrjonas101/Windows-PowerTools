There is a collection of [third-party plugins](./doc/thirdPartyRunPlugins.md) created by the community that aren't distributed with PowerToys.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions of all types.  Besides  coding features / bug fixes,  other ways to assist include spec writing, design, documentation, and finding bugs. We are excited to work with the power user community to build a set of tools for helping you get the most out of Windows.

We ask that **before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute**, please read our [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). We would be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach, provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.
